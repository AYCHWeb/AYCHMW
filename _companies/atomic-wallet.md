<p>Apart from the intuitive UI, Atomic Wallet offers a wide range of features, such as a decentralized storage for private keys, built-in option to buy crypto with a bank card, Atomic Swaps, instant exchange via Changelly or Shapeshift and an interface for custom tokens. What makes Atomic Wallet so unique is the support of Atomic Swaps, a relatively new decentralized exchange technology based on hash timelock contracts. Currently, this feature is available for Bitcoin, Litecoin and QTUM. In the nearest future, Atomic Wallet plans to make Ethereum available for the swaps, as well.</p>
