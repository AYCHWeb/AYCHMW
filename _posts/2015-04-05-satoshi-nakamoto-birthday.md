<p>Software programmers often leave Easter eggs in their code for people to find.
<p>The symbolic birthday of the pseudonymous Bitcoin creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, appears to be 5 April 1975 and a significant Easter egg.
<p><h2>How 5 April 1975?</h2>
<p><a href="http://p2pfoundation.ning.com/profile/SatoshiNakamoto">Ning/P2P Foundation</a> requires a birthdate for signups, and displays for every member an age calculated from that birthdate. This is the basis for ages given for Satoshi.
<p>However, the age changes each year. For example, based on archives collected by Archive.org the profile for Satoshi Nakamoto:
<p><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20110317060514/http://p2pfoundation.ning.com/profile/SatoshiNakamoto">age: 35 in 17 March 2011</a>

<p>Watching these increments, on 4 April 2014 the profile displayed 38 and 5 April 2014 it displayed 39.
<p>Consequently, 5 April 1975 because 2014-39=1975.
<p><h2>Why 5 April 1975?</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_5#Events">5 April</a> does not seem to be a special date. it is not a round number, symbolic date, not your usual fake birthday like 1 January or April Fools Day, it is not the day Satoshi signed up for P2P ("Satoshi Nakamoto is now a member of P2P Foundation Feb 11, 2009"), not related to when Bitcoin was released (3 January 2009) or when the domain was registered (18 August 2008).
<p>Thus, it seems like a good guess at a birthday.
<p>But why would Satoshi choose this specific date? Perhaps he was leaving an Easter egg regarding his motivations with Bitcoin.
<p>On 5 April 1933 U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_6102">executive order 6102</a> "forbidding the Hoarding of Gold Coin, Gold Bullion, and Gold Certificates" by U.S. citizens.
<p>This was a gross infringement on monetary sovereignty of the individual and a major violation of the United States Constitution which (1) does not empower under Article 1 Section 8 the Federal government to make anything legal tender and (2) requires under Article 1 Section 10 Clause 1 for legal tender to be only gold or silver.
<p>In 1975 the limitation on gold ownership in the U.S. was repealed after President Gerald Ford signed a bill legalizing private ownership of gold coins, bars and certificates by an act of Congress codified in <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/93rd-congress/senate-bill/02665">Pub.L. 93–373</a> which went into effect December 31, 1974.
<p>Consequently, Satoshi appears to have left an Easter egg via his birthday regarding the infringement and restoration of monetary sovereignty.
<p><h2>More Easter Eggs</h2>
<p>There are likely more Easter eggs which have been left by Satoshi Nakamoto.
<p>For example, in 2014 Bitcoin thought leader <a href="https://www.tracemayer.net/">Trace Mayer</a> left a major clue about the reason Satoshi released Bitcoin on 3 Jan 2009.
